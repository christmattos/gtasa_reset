# gtasa_reset

I made this script for faster resets in speedrun  

This script do the following steps:  
block the input  
close gta process  
delete saves and replay  
focus on dxwind  
search the gta icon on dxwind  
get the current mouse position  
move the mouse to gta icon  
double click it  
move the mouse to original position  

if your dxwind dont skip the rockstar spray cutscene and etc, it'll do this, if it skips just delete the lines before the blockinput off  
wait (it may vary to from computer to computer, so test the script before, mine 1k ms works just fine  
send enter down and up
