# gtasa_reset

I made this script for faster resets in speedrun  

This script do the following steps:  
block the input  
close gta process  
delete saves and replay  
focus on dxwind  
search the gta icon on dxwind  
get the current mouse position  
move the mouse to gta icon  
double click it  
move the mouse to original position  
unblock the input  

if your dxwind dont skip the rockstar spray cutscene and etc, it'll do this, if it skips just delete the lines before the blockinput off  
wait (it may vary to from computer to computer, so test the script before, mine 1k ms works just fine)  
send enter down and up  
unblock the input  

What do i need to do to use this script?  

1° - Download the source by clicking on "<> Code" and "Downloading ZIP"  
2° - Extract it  
3° - Edit the file "resetar.ahk" and put your "GTA SA User files" path. You can delete the FileDelete functions to do not delete any save at all or just the ones that you dont wanna. If your dxwind dont skip the rockstar spray cutscene and etc, dont edit anything, if it skips just delete the two lines before the blockinput off  
4° - Run the script
5° - Press F4 (or other any key, you can edit it) with the dxwind open
6° - You're done!))
